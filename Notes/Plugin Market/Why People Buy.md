# Why people buy plugins

Networks who have lots of developers still decide to buy plugins instead of spending time and paying their developers lots money. Most premium plugins 10-50 dollars. Much cheaper than paying your developers to make alternatives. When it comes to making plugins, your main audiences are going to be casual people and networks.

## Network oriented plugins
Plugins that have some features like an API that you would want to use. Not really for the average player who would buy a plugin for their small friend server.
Example: ChatControl

## Casual oriented plugins
Made for people who play Minecraft with friends in their own server. 

## General oriented plugins
Plugins that have use cases for both audiences.
Examples:
	ItemsAdder
	Mythic Suite
