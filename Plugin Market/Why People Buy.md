# Why people buy plugins

Networks who have lots of developers still decide to buy plugins instead of spending time and paying their developers lots money. Most premium plugins are 10-50 dollars. Much cheaper than paying your developers to make alternatives. When it comes to making plugins, your main audience are going to be the casual people and the networks.

## Network oriented plugins
Plugins that have some features like an API that you would want to use. Not really for the average player who would buy a plugin for their small friend server.
Example: ChatControl

## Casual oriented plugins
Made for people who play Minecraft with friends in their own server. 

## General oriented plugins
Plugins that have use cases for both audiences.
Examples:
	ItemsAdder
	Mythic Suite

## And this is why customization is very big!
Your plugin needs to be customizable so your plugin can fit the needs for both types of buyers. Also make sure your plugin is NOT TOO CHEAP: you will attract the wrong buyers, they will leave a bad review and ask for a refund. You can also attract stupid people who will file a chargeback than simply asking for a refund. Make sure you make everything clear and making your plugin easy to understand to make sure people don't do this to you.
