ItemsAdder's font images (HUD used font images) don't support GIFs (surprise surprise). Animating HUDs in 20+ fps requires using texture pack shaders and it's too expensive (spend time working on other things, it'll be better) and you might need to hire GLSL devs which is not needed. No one cares about having 240+ fps HUD!
